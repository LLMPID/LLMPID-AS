# LLM Prompt Injection Detection API Service (LLMPID-AS)
The LLM Prompt Injection Detection API Service is a PoC that aims to provide an easy to use and "manage" interface for context-based detection of prompt injections that can be implemented alongside Large Language Model(s)-enabled services (eg. chatbots, document processors, etc.).

The project provides an HTTP API that allows other systems (or users) to detect prompt injections by sending a request with the prompt provided to their LLM service. The prompt is then classified based on a fine-tuned BERT model.

Important: The current version is a PoC and lacks authentication and authorization functionalities. It can still be implemented as an internal service.

# Why we made it?
We, along with a few of our friends, needed a simple, plug-and-play solution for detecting prompt injection in projects that utilize LLMs. A dedicated detection/classification layer allows developers to focus on building core product functionalities while offloading this aspect of security to an easy-to-integrate solution.


# The Internals
The project consists of 3 key segments, encapsulated into a Docker image (see how to quickly configure and build via docker-compose below):
* The main LLMPID API (located under `/backend/llmpid_api`) that is written in Golang and handles all the requests from the frontend and other services that can be connected.
* An internal classifier service (located under `/backend/internal_classifier_service`) that loads handles the BERT model itself written in Python. It communicates with the main API inside a bridge internal Docker network. The solution is not the most elegant but was chosen due to technical issues with loading ONNX models in Golang. It is temporary and will probably be replaced once we fully handle the model handling inside the main API.
* The frontend (located under `/frontend`) which allows users to monitor classification (detection) requests to the API, along with the results.

Additionally, Traefik is used to route traffic between containers and allow the frontend and backend to run on one address. Postgres is used as the main database, containing the classification logs.

The backend and frontend are the only "publicly" exposed services. The internal classifier service and database are bridged internally and are not directly accessible.


# Setup
The `.env` file defines the credentials required to create, use, and access the database container, as well as the HOST port for the main LLMPID API. To modify the default values, simply edit the `example.env` file in the project's directory and rename it to `.env`. It is recommended to keep `DB_USER` set to `postgres`. The file is automatically loaded when running docker-compose.

The fine-tuned model that performs the classification of prompt injections is downloaded from [https://llmpidas-model.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/model.onnx](https://llmpidas-model.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/model.onnx) when the docker images are built via `docker-compose`. You can access the download URL manually and get the model for other purposes, as well. It can be found in `<DOCKER_WORKDIR>/backend/internal_classifier_service/model_data/model.onnx` inside the container of the API.

To run the full service:
* To verify the compose configuration:
```bash
docker-compose config
```
* And to compose and run it as a daemon:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```


# HTTPS
LLMPID-AS has authorization on all routes except `/login`, which is reserved for administrator users and external systems.  

Access to authorized routes requires one of two roles: `admin` or `ext_sys`, with some routes accessible to both.  

# Authentication and Authorization
### Roles  

#### `admin` Role (Administrator Users)  
- Grants access to all endpoints.  
- Access tokens (JWTs) are valid for 60 minutes.  

#### `ext_sys` Role (External Systems)  
- Assigned to regisgtered third-party services for using classification routes (e.g., external APIs, chatbots).  
- Can only access routes under `/api/system/external/*` and `/api/classification/*`.  
- Access tokens (JWTs) are valid for 500 days.  

### Session Management  

Authenticated users and external systems can have multiple active sessions. Access can be revoked:  
- **Per session** – by supplying the session’s JWT on logout.
- **For all active sessions** – by revoking all issued tokens.

# Endpoints
## User Login
### Endpoint
```http 
POST /api/user/auth/login
```
### Description

### Description
Revokes the current user session or all live user sessions. This is determined by the presapresence of the `all=true` URI parameter.
### Example Request (Current Session):
```http
PUT /api/user/auth/logout
```
### Example Response:
```HTTP
Status 200
```
### Example Request (All Active Sessions):
```http
PUT /api/user/auth/logout?all=true
```
### Example Response:

```

## Register External System
### Requirements
* Valid session and `Authorization` header.
* Role `admin`.
### Endpoint
```http 
POST /api/system/external
```
### Description
Registers an external system to access the /classification routes of the API. Any third-party service using these routes is considered an 'external system.' The registration process requires a `system_name` parameter, chosen by the user. After successful registration, the API returns a secure access key, which the external system must use for authentication.
### Example Request (Current Session):
```http
POST /api/system/external

{
  "system_name": "chatbot_banking_v0.1"
}
```
### Example Response:
```HTTP

}
```

## Authenticate External System
### Endpoint
```http 
POST /api/system/external/auth/authenticate
```
### Description
Essentially, this logs in an external system, creates a session, and issues an access token valid for 500 days (as to not be permanent). A system can have multiple active sessions, each of which can be revoked individually or all at once. The token grants access to routes that require the `ext_sys` role.
### Example Request (Current Session):
```http
POST /api/system/external/auth/authenticate

{
  "system_name": "chatbot_banking_v0.1",
  "access_key": "8657a8f480621ef395de191d4e89741841bb3d2e6d748b20dc6e33dee602cf1c"

# Configuration files
There are two main configuration files - one for the whole docker-compose environment and one for the LLMPID API.
* The LLMPID API configuration files is located in `<REPOSITORY>/backend/llmpid_api/config/config.yaml` that contains the configuration for the main API service:
```yaml
host:
  port: "8080" # The port on which the API will be started inside the Docker container
  environment: "development" # Environment type
  logFilePath: ./log # Where logs will be generated


# The user and password variables will be overwritten by environmental variables on initialization of the API
database:
  host: "postgres_db" # The host of the Postgres container.
  port: "5432"
  name: "llmpid"
  user: ""
  password: ""

classifier:
  classifierAPIPath: "http://internal_classifier_srvc:8001/classify" # The host of the internal classifier service container.
```

All values are adjustable, but changes should be coordinated with modifications in the `docker-compose.yaml` configuration to prevent unexpected behavior or failures. The `logFilePath` can be set to a shared directory.

* The full environment configuration file that is called `example.env` by default and should be renamed to `.env`, as mentioned above:
```bash
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=<>
HOST_PORT=8080
```

`DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD` are used to create the Postgres database image and setup it. Furthermore, the LLMPID API will use them on runtime to obtain credentials for database access. `HOST_PORT` is the port on which the main API will be available to the host.

# Limitations
The current limitations are presented by the system itself and the context analysis model that we have trained.  

The system does not support prompt analysis and injection detection on multiple prompts that are chained together. It treats each prompt analysis request as a separate and isolated entry.  

The BERT model we use for context analysis and injection detection is trained on data from multiple combined datasets. However, it can still be considered a limited training sample. Therefore, we are currently working on expanding the training dataset and re-training the model for higher accuracy.

# Branching Strategy
The project branching uses the following structure:
* `master` - the main branch containing the fully functianal system.
  * Branches with prefix `hotfix` (eg. `hotfix/textbox-spelling`) - quick or emergency fixes that don't have to go to development and be tested.
* `dev` - the development branch of the code.
  * Branches with prefix `feature` (eg. `feature/authentication`) - feature branches of the `dev` branch.


# TODO
We have decided to expand the project with the following features:
* Authentication and authorization - for the administrator panel and the API itself.
* Model loading inside the main Golang API.
* Conversation session tracking - track the conversations in order to create larger message context and detect injections through batched prompts.
* Re-training of the classification model with a better dataset.

# Known Technical Debt
* Error handling.
